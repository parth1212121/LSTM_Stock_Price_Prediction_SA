422427440,"TSLA Deutsche Bank analyst Emmanuel Rosner raised the price target on Tesla to 1,200.00 from 1,000.00 while maintaining a Buy rating. The analyst comments quotWe continue to believe Teslas trajectory for its battery technology, capacity and especially cost could help accelerate the worlds shift to electric vehicles and extend Teslas EV lead considerably. We leave our outer year forecasts largely unchanged, calling for 2025E revenue of 145bn, predicated on 3m vehicles, generating gt23 EPS. Beyond it, we expect to see considerable additional growth beyond vehicles, as Tesla scales up its battery capacity closer to 3TWh globally by 2030, unlocking large endmarkets. We raise our price target from 1000 to 1200, now based on the average of 60x our 2025 EPS and EVsales multiple of 16x 2023 both discounted back, as we believe Teslas strong and accelerating growth profile, and its widening technology and cost leadership could support higher valuation.

Just being honest. Do not know what all the Tesla Fanboys are excited about on here. I predict there will be a pump pm because of low volume, which will permit institutional investors to dump during cash. Contrary to what the Fanboys claim, Tesla is an automaker because it relies on the manufacturing and sale of vehicles to generate most of its revenue... just like the other automakers. Accordingly, its ridiculous high valuation will deflate these next few months. For people to claim Tesla as an AI company because of FSD, they would have to do the same with Mercedes, Ford and GM, which also have autopilot driving features in their vehicles.",2022-01-03,Bearish,7.0,0,"[3.5132415, 2.034596]",0

However the Intrinsic value is currently 2.32 based on a closing price of 9.22. Furthermore if the company redeemed on a cashless basis the value would be even higher assuming an adjustment of .6 to the current cashless table from the prospectus.

Levy increased 2030 volume and gross margins to now expect 7.1 million units of volume in 2030 vs. prior 6.3 million. At this number, Tesla is estimated to become the 6th largest carmaker in the world by 2030. The higher price target also reflects an increased 2022 EPS estimate to 12.66, up from 8.34. We believe favorable fundamentals can continue to support Tesla stock. Yet nonfundamental factors will also need to remain supportivei.e. Teslas trading multiple will need to remain lofty.

That means Tesla would have to produce at least 1.4 million cars in 2022. The rate of growth depends on the capacity of the equipment, its operational efficiency, and the capacity and stability of the supply chain.

That is not market effeciency and no small group of individuals should profit from manipulating a stock. This is precisely the reason the Fed needs to tighten the money supply ASAP. Once it becomes too expensive to borrow funds, crooks are less likely to run the risk in playing these games. As the money supply tightens, this stock will continue to trend downward.

Unfortunately the reality is that the broader market in general needs to drop. Tesla needs to come back down to reality. And a lot of people are going to lose money and then theyre going to sell those losses and be skeptical about ever putting money back in the market again.

Other advantages include additional time to perfect its product or service and setting the market price for the new item. First movers in an industry are almost always followed by competitors that attempt to capitalize on the first mover39s success and gain market share.

The adverse implications of such control is it destroys all price discovery, allows for corrupt members who are at the Fed to exploit this knowledge to their personal gain, protects companies from malfeasance and unethical corporate conduct by insulating the company share price, undermines market efficiency and distorts valuations. For example, a major conflict just broke out in Europe. The economic ramifications of this conflict were certainly fuel inflation in the U.S. The market naturally took a dump, which a healthy market is supposed to do in order to price in the adverse implications of the conflict in Europe. The Fed39s proxies proceeded to buy high volumes of futures contracts to push up the stocks in that index.

Thats sort of a doubling down of Bitcoin and ARK sentiment even during Massive Negative sentiment and Downturns. When Bitcoin finally runs, ARKW will also get another tailwind. TSLA was likely massively bought by ARKW at the open. If Tech, Bitcoin,Tesla all get wind in their sails, this could be quite a rebound for the next 12 months. ARKW was the first ARK Fund to own GBTC back in 201415 but when ARKK started buying, it really took off. This morning GBTC hit an interesting technical area that ARK has previously used as a buy.

But now the Tesla bulls might actually like what analysts are saying now about the stock. Analysts now think Tesla39s shares should trade up 20.1 over the next 12 months to 961.70. If they39re right, it would mark a return to form for this volatile, but solid longterm outperformer. At that price, Tesla39s market value would hit 993.9 billion, just shy of the trilliondollar mark and nearly 140 billion more than it39s worth now. And it39s not just speculation on a bounceback, which is a risky move in this SampP 500. Analysts think the company will make 55 more in profit this year than in 2021, or 10.50 a share. Meanwhile, revenue this year is seen jumping more than 50 to 81.8 billion.quot",2022-02-25,Bullish,,1,"[2.0412977, 2.2922535]",1
